        <h3>Here are some fun facts about the state of New York!</h3>

        <p class = "p1">New York is the third most populous state in the United States, falling just behind California and Texas. 
            It has an approximate population of 19 million residents, with a little more than 8 million living in New York City by itself. 
            Coincidentily, the population of New York State is larger than the country of Netherlands.
        </p>

        <p class = "p2"> New York was one of the original thirteen colonies that formed the United States. 
            It was initially called New Amsterdam when it was first discovered and settled by the Dutch. 
            However, it was later conquered by the British and its name was changed in the honor of Englandâ€™s Duke of York. 
        </p>

        <p class = "p3"> New York state is home to Niagara Falls, one of the most famous waterfalls in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year. 
            It is located on the border of Ontario, Canada, and upstate New York.
            Niagra falls was also the first state park in the United States when New York made it the Niagara Reservation in 1885. 
        </p>

        <p class = "p1"> New York state is home to a variety of nationally recognized sports teams.
            There are the Rangers and the Islanders for hockey. 
            We have the Yankees and Mets for Baseball.
            For basketball we have the Knicks and the Nets. 
            There is also the Giants and Jets for football.
        </p>

        <p class = "p2"> New York City in particular from the state is considered to be the financial capital of the world.
            The city is responsible for hosting a busy economy, and is where all the trading of teh stock markets occur.
            It's the city most Americans beleive where dreams are made, and will often consider moving here just for the opportunities.
        </p>

        <p class = "p3"> New York is very diverse in the amount of cultures, and ethnicities present in the state, more so in the New York City area.
            It is home to some of the largest ethnic groups outside of their respective countries. 
            This is one of the main reason as to why it is considered the melting pot state.
            One great benefit from this is all of the great foods of teh world you get to try when you visit NYC.
