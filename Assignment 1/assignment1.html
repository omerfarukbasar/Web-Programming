        <h1>Hello, my name is Omer Basar</h1>

        <p>
            Third-year computer science student, future software engineer.<br>
            My passion for coding started during my first year at Adelphi University, 
            where my professor introduced me to the marvels of programming in Python and Java.<br>
            From there on, I have taken more programming classes where I have learned about data structures, 
            algorithms, computer networks, databases and more.
        </p>
